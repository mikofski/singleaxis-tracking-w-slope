    "# Proposal to add sloped terrain not parallel to tracker axes\n",
    "\n",
    "The following snippets demonstrate how single axis trackers can be modified to accomodate sopes not parallel to the tracker axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Plane\n",
    "The system plane is a new parameter that is a tuple representing the azimuth and zenith of the normal to the plane that contains the tracker axes. It is called the system plane and not the slope or terrain plane, because it is defined by the plane that contains the tracker axes, even though the trackers might not be parallel to the system azimuth. EG: An E-W slope with N-S trackers; the slope normal faces either east or west, while the tracker axes are N-S.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculated Axis Tilt, Side Slope, and Relative Rotation\n",
    "Three new functions are added to calculated to adapt the single axis tracker to accomodate the system plane:\n",
    "* the **tracker axis tilt** is calculated as a function of the tracker azimuth and the system plane\n",
    "* the **side slope** is the slope of the system perpendicular to the tracker axes\n",
    "* the **relative rotation** is the azimuth of the tracker axes relative to the system plane azimuth\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Changes\n",
    "Once the tracker axis tilt, $\\theta_{tracker}$, is calculated then the existing `pvlib.tracking.singleaxis()` function can be used by setting the tracker axis to the calculated value. However two additional changes must be made to account for the system plane if it is not parallel to the tracker axes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the condition for backtracking and the rotation calculation should have the side slope applied\n",
    "\n",
    "* the max angle should also be applied with the side slope in consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "With these 2 changes in `pvlib.tracking.singleaxis()`, the proposed 2 new functions for calculating **axis tilt**, **side slope**, and **relative rotation**, and the concept of the **system plane**, then pvlib-python can handle trackers on sloped terrain, which is an emerging topic encountered in many PV projects in 2019-2020."
